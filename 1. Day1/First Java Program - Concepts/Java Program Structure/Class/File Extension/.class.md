# Java Class File Information

In Java, the `.class` file is an essential part of the compilation and execution process.

- The `.java` file, which contains the human-readable **source code** you write, is converted into a `.class` file using the **Java compiler**, known as `javac`.
- The **`.class` file contains bytecode**. Bytecode is an **intermediate format** that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can understand and execute.
- The purpose of converting `.java` files into bytecode (`.class` files) is crucial for Java's portability. Once a `.java` file is compiled into a `.class` file, that **bytecode can be run on any machine that has a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, regardless of the underlying operating system or hardware. This is referred to as sharing the bytecode, and others will be able to run it because of the JVM.
- The process is described as compiling the `.java` files, and then these are converted into `.class` files which contain the bytecode.
- To execute the Java program after compilation, you use the `java` command followed by the name of the main class (which corresponds to the `.class` file). For example, to run a compiled `Main.class` file, you would use `java Main`. This execution process involves the JVM running the bytecode contained in the `.class` file.
- When you compile a `.java` file using the `javac` command (e.g., `javac Main.java`), if there are no errors, a corresponding `.class` file (e.g., `Main.class`) is created in the same directory by default.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like IntelliJ IDEA handle the compilation process automatically, including the creation of the bytecode or `.class` files. You can see the compiled bytecode (`.class` files) generated by the IDE. The IDE typically places these compiled output files (the `.class` files) in a dedicated output or build folder, which is considered a good practice, separating the source code (`.java` files) in an `src` folder from the binary output (`.class` files).
- In essence, the `.class` file is the **compiled version** of your `.java` source code, containing the machine-independent instructions (bytecode) ready to be executed by the JVM.

### Exercise

Compile and run a simple Java program to observe the creation of the `.class` file.

1. Create a file named `HelloWorld.java` with the following content:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

2. Compile the program using the command `javac HelloWorld.java`.
3. Run the program using the command `java HelloWorld`.
4. Observe the creation of the `HelloWorld.class` file and the output of the program.
